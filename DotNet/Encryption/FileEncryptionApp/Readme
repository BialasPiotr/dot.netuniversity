# File Encryption App

The File Encryption App is a simple desktop application developed in C# using Windows Forms. The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt text files utilizing either TripleDES or AES encryption algorithms.

## Encryption Algorithms

**TripleDES (3DES):** This is a symmetric encryption algorithm. It's an evolution of the original DES algorithm, which is now considered insecure due to advancements in computational power. TripleDES applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block, thereby significantly enhancing the security but at the cost of performance.

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** This is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information and is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. It is one of the most secure and fastest encryption methods that are publicly accessible.

## Application Operation

The application's main form includes the following controls:

- **btnEncrypt:** A button to start the encryption process for the chosen file.
- **btnDecrypt:** A button to initiate the decryption process for the selected file.
- **txtFilePath:** A text field to input or display the selected file's path.
- **btnBrowse:** A button to open the file explorer and choose the desired file for encryption or decryption.
- **rdoTripleDES and rdoAES:** Radio buttons to choose the preferred encryption algorithm.

Clicking `btnBrowse` opens a file selection dialog, enabling the user to select a file for encryption or decryption. The selected file's path will automatically appear in the `txtFilePath` field.

After selecting the file, the user can choose either the TripleDES or AES encryption algorithm. Following this, clicking on `btnEncrypt` will start the encryption process for the selected file, whereas clicking on `btnDecrypt` will decrypt the file. The resulting encrypted or decrypted files are stored in the same directory as the input file with prefixes "encrypted_" or "decrypted_" added to the original filename.

## Running the Project

Follow the steps below to run the application:

1. Clone the repository to your local file system.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Ensure all required NuGet packages are installed.
4. Run the project by pressing `Ctrl+F5`.
5. In the main form of the application, click `btnBrowse` and select a file for encryption or decryption.
6. Choose an encryption algorithm by selecting the appropriate radio button.
7. Click `btnEncrypt` to encrypt the chosen file, or `btnDecrypt` to decrypt it.
8. Navigate to the directory of the input file to view the resulting encrypted or decrypted files.

## Important Information

- The output files (encrypted or decrypted) are saved in the same directory as the source file.
- The resulting files are named by adding the "encrypted_" or "decrypted_" prefix to the original filename.
